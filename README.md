# ChessTimer
Full Functionality Mobile Chess Timer. Coded using Jetpack Compose.

I was walking inside a room and saw people play chess. 
However, they had to use their built-in timer app to time themselves while playing. 
They had to use two phones in order to play with a timer. 
So I decided to create this application with 3 game modes:

Rapid Chess (25:00)
Blitz Chess (05:00)
Bullet Chess (02:00)

The app has a reset timer option and a pause timer option.
Press your own timer after every move you make to turn your timer to pause
and turn the other timer to play.
